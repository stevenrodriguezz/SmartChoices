*This is our submission for the Vanguard challenge* : *"Take a stand for all communities. Hack on any topic that youâ€™re passionate about which impacts minority communities."*

**Why are we doing this?**
- Financial literacy education is lacking in K-12 programs around the country
- Financial literacy enabled our team made up of two hispanic first-generational immigrants to achieve financial stability and social mobility
- As part of the university that is #1 in social mobility in the United States, we want to champion this ideal beyond our campus into our broader community
- We believe that there can be fun, engaging, and thought-provoking ways to teach financial literacy in a school setting
- We believe that high school students are the most vulnerable group to making unwise financial decisions during the transition into adulthood, so they are our target audience
